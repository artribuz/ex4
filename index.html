            <h1>My Phone Maeby</h1>
            <p>This thing gets me through my day. If I left it at home I would be without communication, without any interconnectivity, without music, without information, and, most importantly, WITHOUT MY CATS ON NEKO ATSUME! What would they do without me? They would have no food to be attracted to! I seriously use my phone for everything and without it I would be lost.</p>

            <h1>My Daily Planner</h1>
            <p>Another useful item in my arsenal to stay on task. I track pretty much everything I need to do, from school work to commitments with friends. It's really helpful to write down all of my tasks and check them off as I complete them.Shoutout to Emily for introducing me to the art of life planning!</p>

            <h1>One of My Favorite Pigma Pens</h1>
            <p>Ahhhh, how I love pens, let me count the ways. This particular pen was one I bought waaaaaay back in Design 1. I love drawing and writing with pen, probably because I wasn't allowed to use pen in school for the first 10 years of my life. Thanks school -_-</p>

            <h1>My Headphones</h1>
            <p>I absolutely love listening to music. It is an important aspect to my life and I wouldn't be me without my own particular taste in music. Music helps me express myself in many different ways, including hellping me get my creative juices flowing. Without my headphones I'd feel disconnected to my inner self.</p>

            <h1>My Trusty Turtle Flashdrive</h1>
            <p>Yes, my flashdrive is a turtle. Well, it's in the shape of a turtle. Whenever he is plugged in he looks like he ran into something and can't get out. It's really adorable. He has all my files for my Design classes on him, plus everything that I need to get printed, usually at Copyland.</p>
